"""
email_routes.py

FastAPI route handlers for the email feature. All non-route logic
(IMAP connection helpers, message parsing, account config, the
auto-summarize + scheduled-email pollers, Pydantic models) lives in:

    routes/email_helpers.py   — synchronous helpers + models + constants
    routes/email_pollers.py   — background loops, started by `_start_poller`

Importing from the helpers module brings in everything those route
handlers need. The split is mechanical — no behavior change.

    #      60s TTL — bodies don't change.
    #   3. _IMAP_POOL: per-account live IMAP connection reused across
    #      requests. Recycled if NOOP fails or it's been idle >60s.
    #   4. Prefetch task: after a list load, kick off background reads of
    #      the top-N visible UIDs so clicks land in the read cache.
